    "\n",
    "On 22 June 1941, Germany began a major attack on the Soviet Union, the communist state that consisted of Russia and a number of neighbouring countries. During the first nine months of the advance, one million German soldiers were killed and many we wounded. \n",
    "\n",
    "The German government has been loosing a lot of money due to the lenght of the war. What was expected to be a quick victory over the soviet state turned into a long lasting battle. Therefore, the government needs to find the cheapest way of transporting its backup units for the occupation of Leningrad, Moscow and Stalingrad. For the transition of the units there are the two cities Warschau and Budapest where the soldiers can regroup before continuing to their final destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"operation-barbarossa.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 650px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "For the transport of the different army units the generals have estimated the costs per soldier per route between the cities of origin, the transitional points and the final destinations. Through communication with the front lines they have gotten requests for few hundred thousand soldiers, which is 75.000 to Leningrad, 60.000 to Moscow and 90.000 to Stalingrad. \n",
    "\n",
    "They know that it is not strategic to generate this amount of soldiers from only one army base in big german cities. But it is smarter to collectively put the necessary number together from the two or three major military bases in the east of the empire: Berlin, Leipzig and Munic. To have a better understanding of the situatuion the generals have created an overview including the transportation costs per soldier in Reichsmark(RMARK), possible capacities(at each location) and the demands.\n",

    "### Interpretation\n",
    "As we can see in the final outcome graphic, we reach the total demand by transporting the units from the two origins Berlin and Munich to the two transition points Warschau and Budapest. There we split up the units between the three destinations.\n",
    "The model has estimated the best way of moving the provided number of units at each arc at the minimum cost possible. The set constrains have been respected and we do not exceed the maximum capacity at any of the arcs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for not sending any troops out from Leipzig is due to the transportation costs. It is cheaper to transport troops from Munic but then to reach the necessary capacity at the transition nodes the rest of the troops have to come from Berlin. Here we have a conflict between the objective and the capacity constraint, since we are trying to minimize the costs but we are also trying to reach the requested capacity at each node in order to satisfy the final demand. Hence, based on the given specifications the model has decided that it is cheapest to skip Leipzig to reach the objective locations, in order to satisfy the demand constraint. Even if the transport costs from Leipzig are way less than the costs from Berlin.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution satisfies the generals, as they can save money for further special military operations on the west front.\n",
